# Rust ML Charniak Thoughts and Implementations

Hi there! This is just a repository for me to keep track of my work and
implementations of various concepts based on Charniak's
Introduction to Deep Learning Book.

My goal is to complete one chapter of the book a week.
(Beginning 05/13/2024)

## Status

[ O ] denotes work in progress as of (MM/DD/YYYY)

[ X ] denotes a complete chapter finished on (MM/DD/YYYY)

1. Feed Forward Neural Nets [ O ] (05/13/2024)
2. TensorFlow [ ]
3. Convolutional Neural Networks [ ]
4. Word Embeddings and Recurrent Neural networks [ ]
5. ...

## Dependencies

ndarray and the ecosystem (ndarray-linalg and ndarray-stats)
are the main dependencies for this project.
